# New Sponsor Event

Stryke Force relies on the support of local businesses to cover our NRG, VEX
and FRC program expenses. Sponsorships can be financial donations or in-kind
donations (services or items that we would have had to pay for). Stryke Force
is continually looking for new sponsors.

The objective of this Stryke Force Olympic event is to identify five potential
new sponsors to the team and then create and deliver a five minute (max)
presentation to “sell” Stryke Force to that business.

There are two challenges in this event. The team may opt to do just #1 or for
bonus points do both:

## Challenge 1

Identify five businesses that (1) are new and (2) you think would want to support
our team. As you do this it is best to start with “friends and family”—those
businesses you or a family member know or have some relationship with or would
like to have a relationship with.

## Challenge 2

Pick one of your five businesses from Challenge 1. Create and deliver a
five-minute presentation. Try to make it personal and specific for that
business.  Consider the question: why would company X want to support Stryke
Force. You can use visual aids but they are not required.

**Note:** you will presenting this to Stryke Force mentors.  This challenge
combines the knowledge of our team and the business you select, *and* your
presentation skills. Think talking slowly, using good eye contact, showing
confidence on the topic.

## Scoring

Scoring will be weighted for businesses most likely to be a good fit for Stryke
Force Additionally your team can earn up to ten points for an effective and
